# projects-updates

This repository contains the source code files that are run when students click the update buttons on their raspbery pi desktop.

Clicking each icon on the pi will download and run the run.sh script from the associated folder in this repository.


### WARNING

When distributing files to student Raspberry Pi's, all files uploaded must be rendered and saved using a Raspberry Pi or other Linux-based system. Uploading a text file created in a windows environment will utilize line endings not recognized by the Raspberry Pi and will not run correctly.
